Q   How do you change a lightbulb in concurrent programming? 

A   You take the lamp to a secure area so nobody else can try to change the lightbulb while you're changing it. 
Alternatively, you might get a lamp with lightbulbs that can't be changed, and just get a new lamp when the lightbulb goes out.
